Multidisciplinary Product Designer, UX/UI, Avid Learner, Design Thinking Advocate and Team Player

I’m a Multidisciplinary Designer currently living in Lisbon and finishing a postgraduate degree in Digital Experience Design.

My passion for continuous learning allowed me to gain education and experience in a wide variety of fields, from Graphic and Industrial Design through 3D and now focusing in Research, User Experience (UX) and User Interface Design (UI).

I'm highly motivated by Mobility and Animal & Human welfare. If we have to leave any footprint, let it be conscious, relevant and non-redundant. I seek solution-oriented questions more than why’s.
